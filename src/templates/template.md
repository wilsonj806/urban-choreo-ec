# Text for everything

## What is this file

This file holds the text for the various sections of the page. Ideally this would be handled via asynchronous import from an external file, but that's slightly beyond what I'm trying to accomplish for v0.5.0. It probably will be added in at some point though as copy and pasting in the text into the relevant sections is not at all efficient.

### [About] Why make the page

So as far as I can tell no one has really made a page dedicated to urban choreography in the East Coast yet. It's about the same for the West Coast although everyone there sort of knows each other already. As this project is being done only by me(for now), not every aspect of the East Coast community is going to be covered, and might not be as accurate as it could be. The page only aims to give a general overview of what urban choreography is like here.

### [About] What is Urban Choreography P1

Urban Choreography/ Urban Dance is a label for choreographed dance that's made with a variety of dance styles. Usually said dance styles are street styles but for the most part its a blend of the dancer's background and the way they listen to music. The big thing for urban choreo is collegiate teams and the competitions where teams would build sets and showcase them.

### [About] What is Urban Choreography P2

Something else to also mention is that the Urban Choreography/ Urban Dance label is kind of a general name for what we do. It's not meant to be an accurate reflection of what "urban dance" actually is but it's the name people are using so for now it will have to do.
