## Description

This is a Single Page App mean to be an article/ series of articles describing the urban choreography community in the East Coast/ NYC Tri-State Area.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to gain more familiarity with React, and the related tools/ libraries relevant to React, by pushing out a fairly simple Single Page App. Said tools include React Router, Storybook, TypeScript, and Jest/ Enzyme.

## Roadmap to v1.0.0
